      <p>
      ORGAN India was formed with the mission of spreading awareness on Organ Donation and Transplantation among all sections and age groups of society.
       We have been working relentlessly to spread the word through all media – social media, campaigns, films, animations, radio, television, blogs etc. 
       We organize awareness drives and conduct awareness sessions in schools, colleges & universities, hospitals, corporate offices, and various organizations
        & associations all across India.
      </p>
      <h2>LET'S GET ORGANIZED – Awareness sessions in Schools</h2>
      <p>
        LET'S GET ORGANIZED is a special campaign launched in 2015 to target schools for raising awareness on organ donation and transplantation among High school students.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Our awareness sessions are suitable for students of classes IX to XII.</li>
        <li>Each session is usually 30-45 minutes long, which includes some short films, a PowerPoint presentation, followed by interaction with the students.</li>
        <li>We distribute some IEC materials like informational booklets specially designed for the students.</li>
        <li>We conduct a quiz at the end of the presentation and make it fun for the students by giving them prizes.</li>
        <li>We encourage maximum participation of teachers and students.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In May 2017, Let’s Get ORGANized got a boost after the Directorate of Education, Government of National Capital of Delhi, passed a directive to all schools of South and Central Delhi to invite ORGAN India to conduct awareness sessions with the students.
      </p>
      <p>
        ORGAN India has successfully conducted awareness sessions at 120 schools all over India, like Modern School Barakhamba Road, Modern School Vasant Vihar, Seth Anandaram Jaipuria School Ghaziabad, Ryan International School, Delhi Public Schools, Kendriya Vidyalayas,(Delhi), Strawberry Fields School, Chandigarh and many more.
